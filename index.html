    **CSE 291: JIT Security**
         [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This is an advanced topics graduate course on secure browser just-in-time (JIT)
compilers. The goal of the class is to understand how modern JITs are designed
and implemented, how attackers are exploiting bugs in JITs, and how to design
more secure---even formally verified---JIT compilers.  We will read research
papers spanning systems security, programming languages, and formal methods. We
will also read articles from the non-academic hacking community and parts of
the Firefox, Chromium, and Safari codebases.  Finally, we will work on an
original research project spanning JIT attacks and defenses.

Evaluation
==============================================================

The primary goal of this course is to prepare to you to do research, the
evaluation for this course is simple: (1) class participation and (2) research
project and presentation.

Participation (30%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You are expected to read the assigned paper(s) before each meeting. In class we
will discuss the interesting parts of the paper(s). You are expected to do any
background reading on your own and come prepared with questions and an
evaluation of the paper. The PhD students in the class are also expected to
lead one discussion section.

Research project (60%) + presentation (10%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You will work on projects in groups of 2-3.  The goal of the project is to
conduct original research in JIT security. You are encouraged to come up with
your own project idea, but we have a few ideas that are well-scoped for a
quarter project.

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to turn in a short research paper
(6-10 pages) and give a 15 minute talk. We will have periodic status updates to
help you stay on track.
